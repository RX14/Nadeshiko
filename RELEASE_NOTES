——— v 2.1  ———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Nadeshiko-2.1

1. Added centering of overlay subtitles which dimensions mismatch
   with video.

Nadeshiko-mpv-2.0.1

2. Since --ff-sid and --ff-aid are found to be broken for E-D releases,
   preview mpv now uses --sid and --aid again.
3. Fixed bug when removed nadeshiko.rc.sh prevented Nadeshiko-mpv from run-
   ning.



——— v 2.0.1  —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Nadeshiko-2.0.1

Hotfix for `create_windows_friendly_filenames` config option.


——— v 2.0  ———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————


1. Configuration, logs and temporary files moved to user’s home directory.
2. RC files format changed, it became more user-friendly with options
   taking “yes” or “no” and bash-specific declarations moved from there
   to their respective scripts.
3. Changed dependency from bhlls.sh to bahelite.sh for bugfixes
   and better error handling, RC files, logs etc.
4. Proper versioning for Nadeshiko, Nadeshiko-mpv and their RC files.
5. Nadeshiko and Nadeshiko-mpv can add a prefix to file name.


Nadeshiko

6. Better FFmpeg compatibility checks – now works with older, stable FFmpeg.
7. WebVTT/SRT, VobSub and PGS subtitles support.
8. External subtitles support for ASS and SRT/WebVTT.
9. Internal check for updates.
10. Encoding modules are taken into separate files, so that
   they served as examples for other codecs (e.g. hardware ones).
11. Time1 and Time2 are now optional parameters.
12. Audio track can be selected. (Before only the default track worked.)
13. max_size_default is now a link to one of the predefined sizes,
    i.e. “normal”, “small”, “tiny” or “unlimited”.
14. Writing metadata to containers.
15. Subtitle and fonts are prepared earlier, so if an error happens on this
    stage, one could notice it faster.
16. Processing of Time and Time2 is reworked and draws closer the time, when
    it would be possible to set multiple time marks and encode a video from
    several fragments.
17. Nadeshiko determines scene complexity.
18. Refactored the code finding optimal bitrate and resolution.
19. Better handling of overshooting.
20. Cleaned work with FFmpeg filters from unnecessary stuff: subtitles and
    fonts processing moved to preparation, this allowed to handle overlaying
    and allow for burning VobSub and PGS.
21. Refactored encoding modules, unified 1 and 2 pass, added more variables.
22. Added more codec-specific variables in the RC file, with descriptions.
23. Added the ability to add custom output options for 1 and 2 passes
    for both libx264 and libvpx-vp9.
24. Can strip “:” and other characters to create Windows-friendly filenames.


Nadeshiko-mpv

25. Menu choosing file sizes uses real values, default value isn’t present,
    added as a mark instead.
26. Can choose presets (nadeshiko.sh configuration files).
27. IPC code moved to separate library.
28. Multiple mpv sockets can be monitored.
29. Better handling of running preview windows with mpv, including the cases,
    when mpv runs in fullscreen.


Bugs fixed

1. VP9 tuning settings are reworked, and now using it provides more or less
   predictable behaviour.
2. Incorrectly passed format for Time1 and Time2 fixed.
3. Fixed several issues with conflicting settings.
4. Fixed wrong `${newarr[total_s]}` due to `$ms` not being converted properly.
5. Nadeshiko-mpv handles errors better, duplicate errors removed.
